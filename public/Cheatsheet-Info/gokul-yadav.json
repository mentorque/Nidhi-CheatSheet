          "back": "I'm a final-year Information Science & Engineering student with strong hands-on experience in building scalable full-stack systems, secure authentication flows, and real-time platforms. I’ve worked on production-grade projects involving WebSockets, cryptographic protocols, PKI, WebAuthn, and distributed APIs. During my internship at Bharat Electronics Limited, I implemented end-to-end encryption for internal communication systems, studied Signal protocol design, and prototyped digital identity workflows using Aadhaar eSign and WebAuthn. My projects include a real-time location sharing platform with sub-second updates, an AI-driven SAFe Agile automation system using FastAPI and NLP, and a cryptographic promise-signing system leveraging WebAuthn and PKI. I enjoy building systems that are secure, scalable, and engineered for real-world use."

          "front": "What are your strengths?",
          "back": "My core strengths are system-level thinking, strong fundamentals in security and backend engineering, and the ability to ship complete, production-ready solutions. I excel at designing real-time architectures, implementing cryptographic workflows, and integrating complex APIs. At BEL, I worked on end-to-end encryption and analyzed Signal protocol internals. In my projects, I’ve built WebSocket engines with sub-second latency, implemented PKI-backed digital signatures, and designed AI-assisted workflow automation with 95% accuracy. I’m also comfortable working across the stack, from React-based UIs to backend services, databases, and DevOps pipelines."
        },
        {
          "front": "What are your weaknesses?",
          "back": "I tend to spend extra time refining system design and edge cases, especially around security and scalability. While this ensures robust solutions, I’ve learned to balance perfection with delivery by prioritizing core functionality first and iterating based on impact. Using Agile practices and milestone-based development has helped me maintain speed without compromising quality."

Action: I went beyond implementation by studying the Signal protocol through WhatsApp’s technical papers, understanding forward secrecy and key ratcheting, and applying those concepts to improve the design. I also prototyped Aadhaar eSign and WebAuthn-based identity workflows. Result: Delivered a more secure, future-ready encryption model and deeper architectural insights that strengthened the overall system design."

          "front": "How do you handle tight deadlines?",
          "back": "I break problems into clear milestones, prioritize core functionality, and ship incrementally. In projects like BeThere and SAFe Agile Automation, I followed iterative development, ensuring each feature was production-ready before moving on. This approach helped me deliver complex systems like real-time engines and AI-powered services within tight academic and project timelines."
