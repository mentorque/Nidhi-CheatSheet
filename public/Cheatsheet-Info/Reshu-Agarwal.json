          "back": "I'm a Software Developer with over 2 years of professional experience building scalable, production-grade systems across banking, e-commerce, and enterprise domains. Currently, I work at AIB in Ireland, contributing to a Java microservices platform that processes 3000+ mortgage applications monthly. I've increased system reliability by 30% through cross-platform automation and reduced document processing latency by 40% using in-memory databases and S3. Previously at Fastenal, I migrated synchronous workflows to event-driven architecture with Kafka, reducing system latency by 30% and improving user engagement by 20%. I also built an automation bot managing 20+ e-commerce shops, saving clients 15+ hours weekly. I hold an MSc in Computer Science from University College Dublin and have strong expertise in Java, Spring Boot, microservices, cloud technologies, and DevOps automation."
