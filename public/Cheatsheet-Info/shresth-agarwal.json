I’ve led product initiatives across consumer apps, AI platforms, and data-heavy systems. My experience spans authoring PRDs, improving user funnels, launching AI-powered features, and driving growth through data-backed decisions. I’ve worked across startups and large organizations like Ola, Physics Wallah, Sun Pharma, and Zero2AI, where I combined product thinking, analytics, and AI to deliver measurable outcomes."
